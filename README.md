# personal_resume - Vue front end app

Overview

There will be three web applications, and the class will be divided into teams respectively:

Backend: Resume Data API: A JSON API exposing student resume data (e.g. contact info, education, work experience, skills, projects, etc.)
Frontend: Personal Resume: A client that allows students to login and access/update their information by communicating with the Resume Data API
Frontend: Community Resumes: A client that displays online public resumes based on the Resume Data API

Backend: Resume Data API
Create database models (See models below). For each model, build an index, show, create, update, and destroy action.
Note: a Rails API will automatically reject any web requests from a different origin. You can configure your app to allow web requests from certain domains using the rack-cors gem.
